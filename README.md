# md2man

Yet another md2man tool. Yes, there are a lot of other tool. A search for
md2man finds 11 other github projects and I guess the version of md2man from
@weakish is almost what I want and need (sorry for not cloning ;-).

This md2man is a wrapper for pandoc, written as a simple bash script. md2man
reads a header from the markdown file and adds title, section and description
information to the manpage.
